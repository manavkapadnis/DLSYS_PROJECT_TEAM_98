## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Don't select "made for kids" on YouTube (will limit playlist)
- ❌ Don't exceed 90 seconds (will be rejected)
- ❌ Don't share as "Public" (use "Unlisted" instead)
- ❌ Don't scroll too fast (let visualizations be visible)
- ❌ Don't forget to include team number in title

## 📊 What the Judges See

Your presentation tells a complete story:

1. **Problem** → Dense attention is O(n²), slow and memory-heavy
2. **Solution** → Block-sparse attention reduces to O(n√n)
3. **Implementation** → CUDA kernels, Needle framework integration
4. **Results** → 2-4× speedup, 75% memory savings, quality preserved
5. **Impact** → Makes transformers practical for edge devices

All shown with **real data, real visualizations, real results**.
